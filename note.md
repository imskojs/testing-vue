# Chapter 1: Understanding Automated Tests

* Regression tests are tests that check that a previously developed still works the same way after the code was changed.
* Continuous Integration(CI): Automated tests make it possible to make a pull request and merge several times a day.
* Continuous Delivery(CD): App is deployed to the staging environment when all the tests in master pass.
* Continuous Deployment(CD): App is deployed to production when all the tests are passed.
